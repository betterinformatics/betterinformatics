**Tip**: If you actually try and do well for the coursework, you'll need less than 40% in the exam to pass the course.

[**Online (flipped-classroom) version of this course. 10x better than the lectures.**](https://youtu.be/rdXw7Ps9vxc?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxersk8fUxiUMSIx0DBqsKZS)

85% **non-calculator** open book exam, 15% across two courseworks. Pass: 40% overall.

In previous years the coursework was assigned weekly, much like the current tutorial questions. That's now (2018) changed with only two five-question courseworks, each worth 7.5% of the final grade. You've still got the weekly tutorial question sheets, but they don't count towards the final mark.
